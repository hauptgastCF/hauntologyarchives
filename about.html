        <p>“Time. Perhaps that’s circular too.”</p>
        <p>The Hauntology Archives is an Instagram blog launched originally in 2023 by Finn Pietrass. It attempts to document the hauntological aesthetic in music, architecture, and the visual arts.</p>
        <p>Jacques Derrida first introduced the concept of hauntology in his 1993 book <em>Specters of Marx</em>. The term is a portmanteau of the word "ontology" (the study of being) and "haunting." Hauntology suggests that the present is always haunted by specters of the past that take influence on, or unsettle the present moment. It challenges the idea of teleological progress, a clean break between past, present, and future, emphasizing how the "ghosts" of past ideologies, unfulfilled promises, and unresolved histories linger and shape contemporary existence.</p>
